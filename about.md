This blog is where I document my adventures, misadventures, and outright confusion as I attempt to transfer a decade and a half of Linux as a daily driver into the strange, glossy, and oddly silent world of macOS. Expect lots of how-to articles, a dash of sarcasm, and probably one too many terminal screenshots.
